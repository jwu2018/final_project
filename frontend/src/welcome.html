            <p>Thank you for taking the time to come visit our site!</p>
            <p>Mental health is a broad and complicated subject. The goal of this website is to present
            statistics and information about mental health and suicide in a way that is 
            engaging on a more personal level. Through interactive visualizations and survey 
            questions, we hope to give you a chance to be more introspective on this topic.</p>

            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Some of the questions we will ask you are taken from the PHQ-9 questionnaire,
            which is a self-administered screening survey for depression. The results from 
            those questions do not necessarily mean that you have depression and you should 
            see a professional for a credible diagnosis.</p>
            <p>Additionally, all your answers will be stored in a cloud database for later
            analysis. We will not be storing any of your private information.</p>
